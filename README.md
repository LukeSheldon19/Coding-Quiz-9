The time complexity of Mini-Max is O(n), as time is only dependent on iterating over an array of length n. The space complexity on the other hand is
O(1), as the space taken up does not change with input size and is only dependent on constant variables.

The time complexity of the Weighted Uniform Strings problem is O(n), as the only time dependent functions in the code are iterating over a String and Arraylist of respective lengths, but the biggest term will dominate in which we just denote O(n). The space complexity is also O(n), as the space taken changes with the size of the input, where the size of said input is indicated by n.
